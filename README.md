# Tour-Guide-Bucharest
_My submission for the tour guide project for Udacity featuring my home city of Bucharest_

On of the assignments we received in the Google Nanodegree scholarship was to create a tour guide app in order to test our understanding of many complex Android features such as custom Objects, `Fragments`, custom `ViewAdapters`, custom `PagerAdapters` and working with `ListViews` and `TabLayouts`.
