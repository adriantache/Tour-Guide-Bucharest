# Tour-Guide-Bucharest
_My submission for the tour guide project for Udacity featuring my home city of Bucharest_

One of the assignments we received in the Google Nanodegree scholarship was to create a tour guide app in order to test our understanding of many complex Android features such as custom Objects, `Fragments`, custom `ViewAdapters`, custom `PagerAdapters` and working with `ListViews` and `TabLayouts`. I had some fun with this and learned a lot more about more complex systems as well as some tangential stuff such as the Material Design specs for lists and tabs and so on.

**Known issues:**
* The first click on a list item sets the OnClickListeners, so it doesn't actually react to touches. This is actually an improvement from previously, but it's something I'm having trouble fixing.
